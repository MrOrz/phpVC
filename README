phpVC - a tiny View-Controller model for PHP.

This tiny framework is just a "wheel" built by me to help me around, 
with NO considerations of scalability or design pattern or anything like that.

The core of phpVC is published under BSD License, 
but ... is there anyone other than me gonna use this piece of sh*tty work ?! :P

The branches are just other projects of mine that is developed upon this 
framework. They are so boring that you might not want to check them out.
